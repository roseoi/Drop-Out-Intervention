# 🎓 Student Performance & Dropout Risk Dashboard — Power BI Project

This project presents an interactive **Power BI Student Performance Dashboard** designed to help institutions identify patterns in student engagement, wellbeing, demographics, and dropout risk. By combining academic performance with behavioural indicators, the dashboard supports data-driven early interventions and strategic decision-making.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The dashboard integrates multiple student-level datasets to produce a holistic view of:

- **Current Semester GPA**
- **Dropout Risk (%)**
- **Mental Health & Social Engagement Ratings**
- **Academic Progress (Credits Completed)**
- **Behavioural Indicators:**  
  - Library Usage Hours  
  - Study Hours  
  - Online Learning Hours
- **Demographic Insights:**  
  - Ethnicity  
  - Gender  
  - Socioeconomic Status  
  - Disability Status
- **Student Personas:**  
  - Quiet Low Wellbeing  
  - High Performers  
  - At-Risk  
  - Disengaged  
  - Hard-Working Consistent Students  

These personas support targeted interventions by highlighting students with similar behavioural patterns.
